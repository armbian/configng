# configng

This is a refactoring of [armbian-config](https://github.com/armbian/config) using [Bash Utility](https://labbots.github.io/bash-utility)
embedded in this project. This allows for functional programming in Bash. Error handling and validation are also included.
The idea is to provide an API in Bash that can be called from a Command line interface, Text User interface and others.
Why Bash? Well, because it's going to be in every distribution. Striped down distributions
may not include Python, C/C++, etc. build/runtime environments

## Quick start

* `sudo apt install git`
* `cd ~/`
* `git clone https://github.com/armbian/configng.git`
* `bash ~/configng/bin/config -m`
  
### If all goes well you should see the man page

## Coding standards

[Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) has some good ideas,
but fundementally look at the code in lib:

```bash
# @description Strip characters from the beginning of a string.
#
# @example
#   echo "$(string::lstrip "Hello World!" "He")"
#   #Output
#   llo World!
#
# @arg $1 string The input string.
# @arg $2 string The characters you want to strip.
#
# @exitcode 0  If successful.
# @exitcode 2 Function missing arguments.
#
# @stdout Returns the modified string.
string::lstrip() {
[[ $# -lt 2 ]] && printf "%s: Missing arguments\n" "${FUNCNAME[0]}" && return 2
printf '%s\n' "${1##$2}"
}
```

Functions should follow ~~filename~~::func_name style. Then you can tell just from the name which
file the function is located in. Return codes should also follow a similar pattern:

* 0 Successful
* 1 Not found
* 2 Function missing arguments
* 3-255 all other errors

Validate values:

```bash
# Validate minimum frequency is <= maximum frequency
[ "$min_freq" -gt "$max_freq" ] && printf "%s: Minimum frequency must be <= maximum frequency\n" "${FUNCNAME[0]}" && return 5
```

Return values should use stdout:

```bash
# Return value
printf '%s\n' "$(cat $file)"
```

Only use sudo when needed and never run as root!
