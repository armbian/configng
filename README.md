### Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains the source code for **Armbian Config**, a versatile and extremly **lightweight configuration utility** designed to simplify and automate common system tasks within the Armbian Linux environment.

Armbian Config provides interactive and scriptable routines for:

- Initial system setup and personalization  
- Networking configuration, including Wi-Fi, VPN, and static IP  
- Sandboxed software installation and system updates  
- Kernel selection, switching, and firmware management  
- Enabling and managing hardware-specific features  

It is especially useful for single board computers (SBCs), helping users quickly prepare a ready-to-use system without manual intervention.

### Quick Start

Armbian Config comes **preinstalled** with Armbian images.

To launch the utility:

1. Open a terminal (locally or via SSH)
2. Run the following command:

```bash
armbian-config
```

### Compatibility

This tool is optimized for use with [**Armbian Linux**](https://www.armbian.com), but in theory, it should also work on any systemd-based, APT-compatible Linux distribution â€” including Linux Mint, Elementary OS, Kali Linux, MX Linux, Parrot OS, Proxmox, Raspberry Pi OS, and others.
