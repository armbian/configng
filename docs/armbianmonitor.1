.SH NAME
.PP
armbianmonitor - A script for monitoring and configuring Armbian
behavior
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[V]#!/bin/bash\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This script serves different purposes based on how it is called:
.IP \[bu] 2
Toggle boot verbosity (works)
.IP \[bu] 2m
Monitoring mode: continually print monitoring info (WiP)
.IP \[bu] 2
Uploading /var/log/armbian-hardware-monitor.log to online pastebin
service
.PP
Without arguments called it should present a simple user interface that
guides through:
.IP \[bu] 2
Installation of RPi-Monitor if not already installed by user
.IP \[bu] 2
Active basic or more verbose monitoring mode
.IP \[bu] 2
Provides monitoring parameters for connected disks
.PP
The second part is WiP and all the user interaction part still
completely missing.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
This script is used to configure armbianmonitor behaviour.
It will ask the user whether to activate monitoring or not, whether to
enable debug monitoring and also how to deal with connected disks.
In fact it walks through the list of available disks, checks them, tries
to patch hddtemp.db if necessary and provides a proposal for
/etc/armbianmonitor/disks.conf when a new disk is found.
.PP
In case monitoring should be activated the following file will be
created: /etc/armbianmonitor/start-monitoring.
If debug output has been chosen, then DEBUG will be written to the file.
.PP
The script will install smartmontools/gdisk if not already installed and
patches smartmontools\[aq] update-smart-drivedb script if necessary.
For disks the \[aq]device model\[aq] will be shown but internally we
rely always on the GUID.
This is the key for entry in /etc/armbianmonitor/disks.conf
.PP
When the script exits and the user activated monitoring it recommends
doing a restart since on the next reboot the
setup-armbian-monitoring-environment script will configure monitoring
sources and decides based on the existence and contents of
/etc/armbianmonitor/start-monitoring whether rpimonitord should be
started or not.
.SH DISK CONFIGURATION FORMAT
.PP
The format of /etc/armbianmonitor/disks.conf is as follows:
.PP
${GUID}:${Name}:${smartctl prefix}:${temp call}:${CRC}:${LCC}
.PP
Two examples:
.PP
A57BF307-7D82-4783-BD1D-B346CA8C195B:WD Green::199:193 # WD HDD on SATA
F8D372DC-63DB-494B-B802-87DC47FAD4E1:Samsung EVO:sat::199: # SSD in USB
enclosure
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The script accepts several options:
.PP
-c $path Performs disk health/performance tests -d Monitors writes to
$device -D Tries to upload debug disk info to improve armbianmonitor -m
Provides simple CLI monitoring - scrolling output -M Provides simple CLI
monitoring - fixed-line output -n Provides simple CLI network monitoring
- scrolling output -N Provides simple CLI network monitoring -
fixed-line output -p Tries to install cpuminer for performance
measurements -r Tries to install RPi-Monitor -u Tries to upload
armbian-hardware-monitor.log for support purposes -v Tries to verify
installed package integrity -z Runs a quick 7-zip benchmark to estimate
CPU performance
.SH TODO
.PP
Develop main functionality ;) asking the user regarding monitoring, deal
with \[aq]SMART overall-health self-assessment test result:\[aq], write
documentation.
