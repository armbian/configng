## Code of Conduct

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. To ensure this, please follow these guidelines:

- **Be Respectful and Considerate**: Remember that our community is global, and language and cultural differences may exist. Avoid using offensive or inappropriate language. Understand that what may be acceptable in one culture could be considered offensive in another.

- **Seek Clarification When Needed**: If you don't understand something, don't hesitate to ask questions. Similarly, if someone asks a question, be patient and provide a clear and helpful response. Avoid being offended by questions or requests for clarification.

- **Communication Challenges**: Recognize that not everyone finds communication easy. If you have difficulty expressing yourself, that's okay. We ask everyone to be patient and understanding, and to focus on the message rather than the way it is conveyed.

- **Be Patient and Understanding**: Recognize that contributors come from various backgrounds and levels of experience. If someone makes a mistake, offer constructive feedback rather than criticism.

- **Encourage Inclusivity**: Make an effort to include everyone in discussions, especially those who might be new or less experienced. Avoid jargon or acronyms without explanations, as these can be confusing for newcomers.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure a positive and productive environment for all contributors. If you encounter any issues or have concerns, please reach out to the project maintainers on GitHub, the Armbian forums, or Discord.
