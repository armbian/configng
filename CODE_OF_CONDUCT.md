## Being Human and Acknowledging Diversity

We recognize that we are all human beings, coming from different backgrounds and with different experiences. We acknowledge that misunderstandings can occur and that behavior acceptable in one culture or context may not be acceptable in another. 

We expect all community members to be open to learning from these misunderstandings and to be willing to adjust their behavior as necessary. We also expect community members to be patient and respectful when misunderstandings occur.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to: harassment, discrimination, personal attacks, or any other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (see [Enforcement Guidelines](LINK_TO_GUIDELINES)).

Please replace `LINK_TO_GUIDELINES` with the appropriate link to your enforcement guidelines.
