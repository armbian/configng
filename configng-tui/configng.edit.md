## Why Config Edit?

As web technologies continue to evolve, the traditional method of editing configurations through text files is also evolving. Config Edit is our response to this evolution. It provides a visual interface for editing configurations, making it easier and more intuitive.

Config Edit is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for editing configurations. From system settings to application preferences, its goal is to simplify the configuration editing process.

## Design Limitations

Config Edit is designed with certain constraints to ensure optimal performance and resource usage. Here are some intentional limitations:

- **Limitation 1**: Config Edit is a static HTML file and does not include any server-side processing or database connectivity.
- **Limitation 2**: Config Edit does not include any client-side scripting, so it does not provide real-time validation or feedback.

Please note that these limitations are by design and are not planned to be addressed in future versions of Config Edit.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to quickly get started with Config Edit:

1. Open `config.edit.html` in your web browser.
2. Edit the configurations as needed.
3. Save your changes and close the file.

Please note that you need a web browser to use Config Edit.

After opening `config.edit.html` in your web browser, you can start editing configurations. Enjoy!

## Navigating Config Edit

Config Edit includes several features to help you navigate:

- **Feature 1**: The `#main_container` section includes two subsections: `#block_section` and `#json_section`.
- **Feature 2**: The layout of these sections changes based on the width of the viewport, providing a responsive design.

## Customizing Config Edit

You can customize Config Edit by modifying the CSS in the `style` section. Here's what each section does:

- `#main_container`: Controls the layout of the main container.
- `#block_section`, `#json_section`: Control the layout of the individual sections.

If you want to modify the functionality of Config Edit, you can do so by changing the HTML in the `body` section. Here's what each section does:

- `#main_container`: Contains the main content of the page.
- `#block_section`, `#json_section`: Contain the individual sections for editing configurations.
