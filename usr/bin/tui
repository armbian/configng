# This script.
# demonstrates the compatibility of multiple interfaces for displaying menus or messages.
# It uses an array to set the options for all three menus (bash, whiptail, and dialog).
# The script checks if whiptail or dialog are available on the system and uses them to display the menu in a more user-friendly way.
# If neither of these programs is available, it falls back to using bash.
# while both are installed falls back to whiptail to display the menu.
# The user can override the default program by passing an argument when running the script:
