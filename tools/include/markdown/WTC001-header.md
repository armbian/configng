Watchtower is a lightweight tool that automatically monitors and updates running Docker containers whenever a new image version becomes available.
It checks remote registries for updated images, pulls them, stops the old containers, and restarts them using the updated versions â€” all without manual intervention.
Watchtower is fully configurable, allowing you to control update frequency, select specific containers, and manage notification settings.
