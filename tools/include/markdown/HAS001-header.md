Home Assistant is an open source smart home platform that allows you to connect your smart home devices like your TV, fan, cameras, thermostats, lights, and sensors. As a user, you can build intricate automation using Home Assistant's user-friendly, unified web-based user interface.

Perfect to run on any single board computer with 4 cores and at least 512Mb of memory. Armbian installation is optimised to run from SD/eMMC media, but it is recommended to use SSD.

!!! danger "Limited support"

    The supervised installation method on Armbian is not officially supported by the [Home Assistant project](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/alternative#install-home-assistant-supervised). Additionally, installation on hardware that is not officially supported is also outside the scope of support provided by the Armbian team.

    You are welcome to report high-level application issues that are reproducible on the official Home Assistant Operating System (HAOS) within the [Home Assistant Community](https://community.home-assistant.io/). For any topics related to single-board computer hardware, you may use the [Armbian Community Forums](https://forum.armbian.com); however, please be aware that official support from the Armbian team is not guaranteed.

    While the Home Assistant team is [planning to deprecate the Supervised installation method](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/feedback-requested-deprecating-core-supervised-i386-armhf-armv7/880968/312), the Armbian team will continue to provide and maintain the supervised installation method as long as automated installation tests remain successful and the maintenance effort remains reasonable.
