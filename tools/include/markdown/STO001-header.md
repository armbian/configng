- Clones your current live OS installation
- Keeps your settings, configuration, installed packages, and user data
- Essentially “transfer my existing system to internal/external storage”

Use this option to **transfer your current live Armbian system** to another storage device (eMMC, SSD, USB, etc.).  This copies your existing installation exactly as it is — including settings, installed packages, and user data.
