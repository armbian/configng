Read-only filesystem is enabled using overlayroot, a utility that places a temporary writable layer over the system root filesystem. Changes made during runtime are redirected into RAM or an alternative writable storage, while the underlying system remains untouched. This ensures that after a reboot, the system returns to a clean original state. It's ideal for kiosks, appliances, SD card-based systems, and scenarios where long-term filesystem durability and recovery are critical.
