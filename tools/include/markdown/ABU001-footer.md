!!! danger "Warning: HTTPS Certificate Required"

    After initially installing the Actual server, you might get stuck at the step:  
    **"Initializing the connection to the local database..."**

    The issue is due to the server not having an **HTTPS certificate**.  
    After activating an HTTPS certificate for the Actual server, everything should work fine.

    If you still encounter issues even after setting up HTTPS, we highly recommend reaching out to the [Actual Budget Discord server](https://discord.gg/actualbudget) â€” the developers and community there are very kind and helpful.
