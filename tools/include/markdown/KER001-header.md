Switching between different kernel versions can significantly impact the functionality of your device. A newer or older kernel may introduce changes to hardware compatibility, drivers, and system stability. Some features may stop working, while others may improve or be reintroduced.

!!! danger "Kernel changes carry inherent risks!"

    - A mismatched or incompatible kernel may result in **boot failures**, rendering the system unresponsive.
    - Certain peripherals or hardware components (e.g., Wi-Fi, GPU acceleration, or power management) may no longer function correctly.
    - Custom configurations or third-party modules might need to be recompiled or adjusted to work with the new kernel.

    Precautions Before Switching Kernels
    Before switching kernels, it is **strongly recommended** to:

    1. **Back up your system** to prevent data loss.
    2. **Verify compatibility** of your hardware and essential drivers with the target kernel version.
    3. **Keep a rescue method available**, such as a bootable SD card / USB drive or serial console access, to recover the system if necessary.

    Recovery Steps if Boot Fails
    If your device fails to boot after a kernel change, you may need to:

    - **Revert to a previous working kernel** using recovery options.
    - **Use a serial console or debug mode** to diagnose the issue.
    - **Reinstall the system** if no recovery options are available.

    **Exercise caution when switching kernels, especially on production systems or devices with limited recovery options.**
