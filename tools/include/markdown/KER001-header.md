## Kernel Switching Warning

Switching between different kernel versions can significantly impact the functionality of your device. A newer or older kernel may introduce changes to hardware compatibility, drivers, and system stability. Some features may stop working, while others may improve or be reintroduced.  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning: Kernel changes carry inherent risks!  
- A mismatched or incompatible kernel may result in **boot failures**, rendering the system unresponsive.  
- Certain peripherals or hardware components (e.g., Wi-Fi, GPU acceleration, or power management) may no longer function correctly.  
- Custom configurations or third-party modules might need to be recompiled or adjusted to work with the new kernel.  

### ‚úÖ Precautions Before Switching Kernels  
Before switching kernels, it is **strongly recommended** to:  
1. **Back up your system** to prevent data loss.  
2. **Verify compatibility** of your hardware and essential drivers with the target kernel version.  
3. **Keep a rescue method available**, such as a bootable SD card / USB drive or serial console access, to recover the system if necessary.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Recovery Steps if Boot Fails  
If your device fails to boot after a kernel change, you may need to:  
- **Revert to a previous working kernel** using recovery options.  
- **Use a serial console or debug mode** to diagnose the issue.  
- **Reinstall the system** if no recovery options are available.  

**‚ö° Exercise caution when switching kernels, especially on production systems or devices with limited recovery options.**
