Non-LTS releases are intended for **developers, testers, and enthusiasts** who want the latest features — **not for production systems**.  

!!! Warning "Risks of Unstable Upgrades"

    Distribution upgrades are experimental and **not supported by Armbian**. Use at your own risk.

    - **High chance of breakage** – dependencies, bootloader, or kernel may fail.  
    - **Short lifecycle** – requires frequent re-upgrades (every ~6–9 months).  
    - **Unfinished features** – packages may be experimental or not fully supported.  
    - **Armbian compatibility** – integration with board support packages is less tested.
