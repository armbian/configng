Kernel headers are files required to build modules (drivers) or software that interfaces directly with the Linux kernel. Installing headers ensures compatibility when compiling custom drivers, DKMS modules (like ZFS, WireGuard), or updating third-party software that requires access to kernel internals. The installed headers match your running kernel version and are critical for system extensions and hardware support.
