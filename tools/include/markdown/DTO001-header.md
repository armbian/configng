Device Tree Overlays allow you to dynamically modify the Linux device tree at runtime, without rebuilding the kernel. They are used to enable or configure specific hardware features (like GPIO pins, IÂ²C, SPI, sensors, displays) on single-board computers. Overlays are small snippets that can add, change, or remove parts of the hardware description, making it flexible to adapt the system for different peripherals without recompiling the full device tree.
