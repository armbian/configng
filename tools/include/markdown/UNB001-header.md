Unbound is a high-performance, open-source DNS resolver. It primarily serves to resolve domain names into IP addresses for devices on a network. Unlike regular DNS servers, Unbound performs DNS lookups directly and securely, providing features like DNSSEC validation (ensuring data integrity) and privacy protections. It's often used to improve speed, security, and privacy by resolving queries locally rather than relying on external DNS services.
