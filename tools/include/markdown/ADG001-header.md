AdGuard Home is a network-wide software that functions as a DNS server and ad blocker. It blocks ads, trackers, and malicious websites at the DNS level, meaning it filters content for all devices connected to the network. It also provides additional features like parental controls, logging, and privacy protections. Essentially, it acts as a gateway between your devices and the internet, blocking unwanted content before it even reaches your devices.
