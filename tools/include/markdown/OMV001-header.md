OpenMediaVault (OMV) is a powerful, open-source network-attached storage (NAS) operating system built on the Debian Linux distribution. It is designed to provide a simple and intuitive web-based interface for managing storage devices and network services, making it ideal for home users, small offices, and even advanced users looking for a customizable and efficient NAS solution.

OMV supports a wide range of features, including various file systems (EXT4, XFS, BTRFS, etc.), software RAID configurations, scheduled backups, and user and group management. It offers support for common network protocols such as SMB/CIFS (Windows file sharing), NFS, FTP, and SSH, enabling seamless file access across different platforms.

Through its modular design, OpenMediaVault can be easily extended with plugins, allowing users to add functionality like Docker support, media servers, cloud synchronization tools, BitTorrent clients, and more. The system is designed for stability and ease of use, with regular updates and a strong community supporting development and troubleshooting.

Whether used on a dedicated server, a Raspberry Pi, or virtualized hardware, OMV provides a flexible and reliable way to build your own custom NAS.  

**Warning**: installation works only on Debian (bookworm) based Armbian image.
