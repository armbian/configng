Long-Term Support (LTS) upgrades provide a **well-tested and stable release** of the underlying Linux distribution (Debian or Ubuntu). These versions receive **security patches and critical bug fixes** for an extended period, making them the recommended choice for production systems and users who prioritize stability over new features.

!!! Note

    While LTS upgrades are considered safe, always back up your data before proceeding with a distribution upgrade.
