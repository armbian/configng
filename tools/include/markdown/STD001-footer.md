Best Practices

1. **Back up your data** (system and configuration).  
2. **Test on a spare device or SD card** before upgrading production systems.  
3. **Read the official release notes** of your target distribution:  
- [Armbian FAQ: Can I upgrade my userspace flavor?](/User-Guide_FAQ/#can-i-upgrade-my-userspace-flavor-like-bullseye-to-bookworm-or-jammy-to-noble)  
- [Debian upgrade notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.en.html)  
- [Ubuntu release upgrade guide](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/software/upgrade-your-release/)  
4. **Ensure you have console access** (serial, HDMI + keyboard, SSH).  
5. **Consider fresh installs** if uptime and stability matter more than keeping the old environment.
