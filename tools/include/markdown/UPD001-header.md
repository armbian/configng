**Enable Armbian firmware upgrades** manages whether the Armbian firmware (kernel + u-boot + firmware) packages are held or unheld in the package manager. By removing or setting the hold, it controls if firmware updates are applied automatically through regular `apt update` and `apt upgrade` processes. This allows users to either freeze the firmware version for stability or enable updates for improved hardware support.
