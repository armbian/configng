Network configuration is simple and easy to follow:

1. Choose the interface. If it's a wireless interface, you'll be prompted to select an access point (AP) and enter its password. Leave empty for open network.

2. Choose between DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or static IP configuration. 

- If you select DHCP, the setup is complete. Optionally, you can change the MAC address.

3. If you choose a static configuration, you'll need to provide:

- An optional MAC address change
- A fixed IP address (e.g., x.x.x.x/y)
- A route (default: 0.0.0.0/0)
- A gateway (usually x.x.x.1/24)
- DNS (default: 9.9.9.9)
