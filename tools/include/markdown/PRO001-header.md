Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects and stores time-series data, provides powerful query capabilities, and enables real-time alerts based on defined conditions. Commonly used in cloud and containerized environments, Prometheus integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes and other modern infrastructure.
