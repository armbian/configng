Network configuration is simple and easy to follow:

1. Choose the interface. If it's a wireless interface, you'll be prompted to select an access point (AP) and enter its password.

2. Choose between DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or static IP configuration. 

- If you select DHCP, the setup is complete. Optionally, you can change the MAC address.

3. If you choose a static configuration, you'll need to provide:

- An optional MAC address change
- A fixed IP address (e.g., x.x.x.x/y)
- A route (default: 0.0.0.0/0)
- A gateway (usually x.x.x.1/24)
- DNS (default: 9.9.9.9)
